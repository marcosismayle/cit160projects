    <h1>PROPERTY REGULATION</h1>
    <p>Many people didn't have the tradition to hire a professional to build their houses and don't have money enough
        to<br>
        buy one. So they start building step by step,even without a project, and before the conclusion, they are
        already<br>
        living there. When they got sick, theysearch for a doctor. But when they needs to construct, anyone can do
        it.<br>
        And there are many irregular buldings.

    <p>Our purpose is to provide a solution for irregular properties in order to provide all the documentation that
        the<br>
        legislation requires and adapt the building to current legislation. And also carry out all the necessary<br>
        procedures to regularize the start of a new venture.</p>
